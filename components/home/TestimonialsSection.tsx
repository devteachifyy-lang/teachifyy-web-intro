        <span className="block mb-2">I had been teaching English for 6 years but never had a certificate to show for it. Every international school I applied to asked for a TEFL and I had nothing. I kept losing opportunities to younger teachers with less experience but more credentials.</span>
        <span className="font-bold not-italic block mb-0.5">After:</span>
        <span className="block">Three months after completing Teachifyy&apos;s TEFL/TESOL programme, I got shortlisted at two international curriculum schools. I now teach Cambridge English at a school in Noida — at a salary I could not have asked for before.</span>

        <span className="block mb-2">My spoken English was fine but I had no structure to how I taught it. Parents would ask me about my qualifications and I would go quiet. I felt like a fraud even though I genuinely loved teaching.</span>

        <span className="block">Now I have a certified methodology behind everything I do in class. Parents see the certificate and ask fewer questions — but more importantly, I finally feel like I deserve to be in the room.</span>
